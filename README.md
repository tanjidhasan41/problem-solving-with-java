# Project Description
This project is a collection of Java assignments designed to practice and enhance problem-solving, algorithm development, and core programming skills. Each assignment focuses on different aspects of programming, such as searching, sorting, string manipulation, and logical operations, providing hands-on experience with Java fundamentals.

The tasks are structured to challenge beginners and intermediate-level programmers, preparing them for real-world problem-solving scenarios.

# Prerequisites
Before running the assignments, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) - Version 8 or higher
- Download it from Oracle's Official Website.
- Java IDE - Any IDE such as:
  - IntelliJ IDEA
  - Eclipse
  - NetBeans

# What I Have Done
This project includes solutions to the following Java programming assignments:

- Search and Sorting Algorithms: Find the 2nd highest CGPA, binary search, and manual sorting.
- Random Number Operations: Generate numbers and find min/max values.
- Pattern Printing: Solve complex output patterns programmatically.
- String Manipulations: Count words, characters, vowels, and consonants. Remove vowels from strings.
- Custom Algorithms: Note breakdown, IP validation, and binary string verification.
- HTML Parsing: Extract transaction IDs using string operations.
- Password Generation: Create secure passwords with custom rules.
- Mathematical Operations: Solve logical problems like distributing question marks and calculating discounts.
- All solutions were implemented programmatically without relying on built-in shortcuts (e.g., Arrays.sort()), ensuring a deeper understanding of the underlying algorithms.

# How to Run the Tests
- Clone the Repository:
  - Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following:
      - git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-assignments.git
      - cd java-assignments

- Open in an IDE:
  - Open the folder in any Java IDE, such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

- Run the Assignments:
  - Each assignment is saved as a separate ```.java``` file. Navigate to the file you want to test.
  - Click the Run button in your IDE to execute the program.
